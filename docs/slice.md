# The `BitSlice` Type

## Introduction

A [`BitSlice`] is a vector-like, non-owning _view_ into a non-empty range of bits.
The bits are compactly stored somewhere else in unsigned integer words.
The default word type is `usize`.

Bit-slices are typically created by borrowing a contiguous range of bits from a [`BitVector`] or a [`BitArray`] using the [`BitStore::slice`] or [`BitStore::slice_mut`] methods.

The type implements the [`BitStore`] trait, which provides a rich API for manipulating the bits in the vector.
This means that bit-slices can be used anywhere a bit-store is expected.
It also means that you can take slices of slices.

### Notes

- A `BitSlice` can only live as long as the underlying store of words exists so has a lifetime parameter.
- The bits in a bit-slice are not necessarily aligned to the word-boundaries of the underlying word store. However, the slice will _synthesize_ appropriate `Unsigned` words from the underlying store as needed.

## Methods Overview

The `BitSlice` type implements the [`BitStore`] trait and has methods for constructing bit-slices:

## Trait Requirements

To implement the [`BitStore`] trait, the type defines the following seven methods:

| Method                  | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`BitSlice::len`]       | Returns the number of bits in the bit-slice.                                         |
| [`BitSlice::store`]     | Provides read-only access to the first _word_ holding bits in the bit-slice.         |
| [`BitSlice::store_mut`] | Provides read-write access to the first _word_ holding bits in the bit-slice.        |
| [`BitSlice::offset`]    | Returns the offset in bits from start of `word(0)` to the bit-slice's first element. |
| [`BitSlice::words`]     | This is always `Word::words_needed(self.len())` but cached for efficiency.           |
| [`BitSlice::word`]      | Returns a "word" from the bit-slice.                                                 |
| [`BitSlice::set_word`]  | Sets the value of a "word" in the bit-slice to a passed value.                       |

Implementing these methods for bit-slices requires some care to ensure that the correct bits are read from or written to the underlying word store, especially when the bit-slice is not aligned to word boundaries.

For a bit-slice, the return value for `store.word(i)` will often be synthesised from two contiguous "real" words `w[j]` and `w[j+1]` for some `j`.
`store.word[i]` will use some high-order bits from `w[j]` and low-order bits from `w[j+1]`.

The following diagram shows how bits in a bit-slice lie within the underlying words, which are `u8`s in this example:

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 0; background-color: #f9f9f9; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

</div>

o satisfy the [`BitStore`] trait, a bit-slice behaves _as if_ bits from the real underlying store were copied and shuffled down so that element zero is bit 0 of word 0 in the bit-slice. However, it never actually copies anything; instead, it synthesises "words" as needed.

The same principle applies to the `store.set_word(i, value)` method.
The implementation of `set_word` for bit-vectors and bit-arrays is trivial, with the one caveat that we have to be careful not to inadvertently touch any unoccupied bits in the final underlying word, or at least be sure to leave them as zeros.

In the case of a bit-slice, calls to `set_word(i, value)` will generally copy low-order bits from `value` into the high-order bits of some real underlying word `w[j]` and copy the rest of the high-order bits from `value` into the low-order bits of `w[j+1]`. The other bits in `w[j]` and `w[j+1]` will not be touched.

## Foreign Traits for Pairwise Bit-Array Operations with Other Bit-Stores

We have implemented several foreign traits from the standard library for bit-vectors interacting with other bit-stores.
